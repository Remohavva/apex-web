# APEX MLRIT - Enhanced Version

This version (`ref1`) matches the "habibi" design but uses a modern Vite + Tailwind v4 stack for better performance and maintainability.

## Recent Improvements
- **Responsiveness**: Adjusted typography and layout for mobile devices (Hero text, Cards).
- **Performance**: Optimized 3D tilt effects to only run on non-touch devices (saving battery and resources on mobile).
- **Smoothness**: Integrated `Lenis` for premium smooth scrolling.

## Commands
- `npm run dev`: Start development server.
- `npm run build`: Build for production.
